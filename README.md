## Welcome to Shokunin (ËÅ∑‰∫∫) üëã

## Overview üìñ

## Getting Started üöÄ

It takes just a few minutes to get up and running with `shokunin`.

### Installation

To install `shokunin`, you need to have the Rust toolchain installed on
your machine. You can install the Rust toolchain by following the
instructions on the [Rust website][13].

Once you have the Rust toolchain installed, you can install `shokunin`
using the following command:

```shell
cargo install ssg
```

For simplicity, we have given `shokunin` a simple alias `ssg` which can
stand for `Shokunin Site Generator` or `Static Site Generator`.

You can then run the help command to see the available options:

```shell
ssg --help
```

### Requirements

The minimum supported Rust toolchain version is currently Rust
**1.68.0** or later (stable).

### Benefits

![Benefits](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sebastienrousseau/vault/main/assets/shokunin/icon/ico-iori.png "Benefits").class="horizontal margin-2" Static site generators like Shokunin offer several benefits over dynamic websites. For one, static sites are much faster and more secure than their dynamic counterparts. With a static site generator, you can generate a site quickly and easily without the need for a server-side language like PHP or JavaScript. It makes static sites perfect for blogs, portfolios, and other types of content that don't require dynamic features like user accounts or e-commerce. Another benefit of static sites is that they're more reliable and easier to deploy. Because static sites are generated ahead of time, there's no risk of a database outage or other server-related issues. Your site will be available 24/7 and won't go down due to a server problem.
